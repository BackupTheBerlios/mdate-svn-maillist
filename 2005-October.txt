Subject: [Mdate-svn] Documentation license
Message-ID: <8511b92f0510060616j24823624i@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I noticed the mdate documentation is currently under the GNU Free
Documentation License, v1.1 or later.

Unfortunately, the Debian project regards this license as non-free,
and documentation under this license will not be included in future
releases:
    http://release.debian.org/removing-non-free-documentation.

Could the documentation be relicensed as regular GNU GPL?

Thanks,
 Quique

-		GNU Free Documentation License
-		   Version 1.1, March 2000
-
- Copyright (C) 2000  Free Software Foundation, Inc.
-     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
- Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
- of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
-
-
-0. PREAMBLE
-
-The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
-written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
-the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
-modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,
-this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
-credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
-modifications made by others.
-
-This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
-works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
-complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
-license designed for free software.
-
-We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
-software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
-program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
-software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
-it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
-whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
-principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
-
-
-1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
-
-This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
-notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
-under the terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to any
-such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and is
-addressed as "you".
-
-A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
-Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
-modifications and/or translated into another language.
-
-A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
-the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
-publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
-(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
-within that overall subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a
-textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
-mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
-connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
-commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
-them.
-
-The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
-are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
-that says that the Document is released under this License.
-
-The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
-as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
-the Document is released under this License.
-
-A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
-represented in a format whose specification is available to the
-general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
-straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
-pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
-drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
-for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
-to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
-format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
-subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is
-not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
-
-Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
-ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
-or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
-HTML designed for human modification.  Opaque formats include
-PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only
-by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
-processing tools are not generally available, and the
-machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output
-purposes only.
-
-The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
-plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
-this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
-formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
-the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
-preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
-
-
-2. VERBATIM COPYING
-
-You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
-commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
-copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
-to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
-conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
-technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
-copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
-compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
-number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
-
-You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
-you may publicly display copies.
-
-
-3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
-
-If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,
-and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
-the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
-Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
-the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
-you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
-the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
-visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
-Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
-the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
-as verbatim copying in other respects.
-
-If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
-legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
-reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
-pages.
-
-If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
-more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
-copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
-a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
-Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the
-general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
-charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter
-option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
-distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
-Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
-until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
-copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
-the public.
-
-It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
-Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
-them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
-
-
-4. MODIFICATIONS
-
-You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
-the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
-the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
-Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
-and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
-of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
-
-A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
-   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
-   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
-   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
-   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
-B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
-   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
-   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
-   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).
-C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
-   Modified Version, as the publisher.
-D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
-E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
-   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
-F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
-   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
-   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
-G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
-   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
-H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
-I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to
-   it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
-   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
-   there is no section entitled "History" in the Document, create one
-   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
-   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
-   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
-J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
-   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
-   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
-   it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
-   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
-   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
-   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
-K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
-   preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
-   substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
-   and/or dedications given therein.
-L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
-   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
-   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
-M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
-   may not be included in the Modified Version.
-N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements"
-   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
-
-If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
-appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
-copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
-of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
-list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
-These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
-
-You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
-nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
-parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
-been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
-standard.
-
-You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
-passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
-of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
-Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
-through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
-includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
-by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
-you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
-permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
-
-The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
-give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
-imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
-
-
-5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS
-
-You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
-License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
-versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
-Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
-list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
-license notice.
-
-The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
-multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
-copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
-different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
-adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
-author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
-Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
-Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
-
-In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History"
-in the various original documents, forming one section entitled
-"History"; likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements",
-and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
-entitled "Endorsements."
-
-
-6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
-
-You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
-released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
-License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
-the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
-verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
-
-You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
-it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
-License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
-other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
-
-
-7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
-
-A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
-and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
-distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version
-of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the
-compilation.  Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this
-License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled
-with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they
-are not themselves derivative works of the Document.
-
-If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
-copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter
-of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
-covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate.
-Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.
-
-
-8. TRANSLATION
-
-Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
-distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
-Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
-permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
-translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
-original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
-translation of this License provided that you also include the
-original English version of this License.  In case of a disagreement
-between the translation and the original English version of this
-License, the original English version will prevail.
-
-
-9. TERMINATION
-
-You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
-as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
-copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
-automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
-parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
-License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
-parties remain in full compliance.
-
-
-10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
-
-The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
-of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
-versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
-differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
-http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
-
-Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
-If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
-License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
-following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
-of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
-Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
-number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
-as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
-
-
-ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
-
-To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
-the License in the document and put the following copyright and
-license notices just after the title page:
-
-      Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
-      Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
-      under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
-      or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
-      with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
-      Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
-      A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
-      Free Documentation License".
-
-If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"
-instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no
-Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of
-"Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.
-
-If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
-recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
-free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
-to permit their use in free software.

Hi Quique!

Ack, this is a problem. Nasty problems with the Creative Commons License too.
I suppose I'll just have to do that, because I want mdate back in Debian and
Ubuntu would be good also.

I've changed the documentation in the repository, there's a tag release of
mdate-1.5.3 at http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/mdate/tags/mdate-1-5-3 for
immediate use, and I'll get a proper release going over the weekend.

Great!

Also: you are the main author, but your name doesn't appear on the AUTHORS file.

I don't think so. I'm probably nitpicking, but as it can be fixed in
